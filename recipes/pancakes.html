    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>As convenient as a store-bought mix can be, 
        every home cook needs a good buttermilk pancake recipe in their repertoire. </p>
    <p>The Allrecipes community can't get enough of these classic buttermilk pancakes. 
        Reviewers say they're light, fluffy, moist, and full of rich flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour contains gluten, 
            which gives the buttermilk pancakes structure and pleasant chewiness.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> Just three tablespoons ofwhite sugar should be enough to lend subtle sweetness.</li>
        <li><strong>Leaveners:</strong>  Baking powder and baking soda act as leaveners (a substance that releases gas when mixed with other ingredients, 
            causing the batter to rise to fluffy perfection).</li>
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong> You definitely don't want to skip adding a small amount of salt 
            â€” the buttermilk pancakes will taste bland without it.</li>
        <li><strong>Buttermilk:</strong>  Of course, you'll need buttermilk for buttermilk pancakes! This recipe calls for three whole cups.</li>
        <li><strong>Milk:</strong> Wholemilk helps create the perfect batter consistency and cuts some of the buttermilk's acidity.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Three whole eggs.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter:</strong> Melted butter lends flavor and keeps the pancakes nice and moist.</li>
    </ul>
